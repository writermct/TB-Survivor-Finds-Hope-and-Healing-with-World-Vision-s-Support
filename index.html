                <h1>TB Survivor Finds Hope and Healing with World Vision's Support</h1>
                <p>
                    Nanu* and her husband, Huli*, live in a bamboo hut perched on a hilltop in Mae Fa Luang, a village located 12 kilometers from the Thai-Myanmar border. Born in the Myanmar jungle as part of the Lahu ethnic minority group, Nanu has now lived in Thailand for 30 years. She’s a mother of three, aged five to 17. “We had five children, but one passed away and the other was adopted by Huli's sister,” she shares.

Like many migrants, Nanu's work depends on what's available—whether it’s carrying sand at construction sites, working on farms, or doing housework. Time and again, she has faced adversity with courage and resilience, and this was especially true when she was diagnosed with tuberculosis at just 25 years old.

            When she began experiencing persistent pain on one side of her body, along with arm spasms and a chronic cough, she didn't know where to seek help. Community members recommended Mae Fa Luang Hospital, where migrants could access free screening and testing. There, doctors diagnosed Nanu with tuberculosis. Reflecting on that moment, she says “I didn’t feel much during this time. I just knew I needed to take the medicine so I could get better and get back to work on the farm.” She started the seven-month treatment and began to recover. With her health improving, she and her husband followed the path of many migrant workers and moved south to Betong for agricultural work. But before long, her symptoms returned. At the hospital in Betong, she was told she couldn’t receive treatment due to her financial and legal status. Huli recalls breaking down in tears but holding onto hope, “I was overwhelmed with sadness, but I knew Mae Fa Luang Hospital would treat her for free. I knew we had to come back.”

            Nanu returned to Mae Fa Luang and began a second round of TB treatment. “I was too sick to work and afraid my kids wouldn’t have enough to eat, but I was very confident the doctor would be able to treat me and I could get back to normal,” she says. During this time, the family relied heavily on support from World Vision. World Vision staff members administered the at-home TB treatments every two weeks and provided essential supplies through Global Fund. “I felt very glad that the World Vision staff came to visit me during this time, and I was very thankful for their help because it meant we had enough to feed the family,” she says. “World Vision came to our home several times with eggs, tinned fish, rice, salt, and noodles.”

                    When World Vision staff visited Nanu for a check-up toward the end of her treatment, she was already back at work carrying sand. Huli beams with pride, “When she started healing, I felt very proud. I also felt very happy that I had a companion again and we could go out to work together.” When asked about her dreams for her future, Nanu’s focus remains practical. “I have to keep fighting—fighting to survive, to earn money, and to keep living. If I can’t work hard, my family won’t have anything to eat.”

   Fighting to survive is the harsh reality for many of the migrants from Myanmar’s ethnic minority groups. In these conditions, contracting tuberculosis doesn't just have grave consequences for the person who is sick—it often means hunger for the whole family. World Vision’s work through the Global Fund, providing tuberculosis testing, treatment, and living assistance, is a lifeline to the migrant communities in Mae Fa Luang. Nanu's story of resilience and recovery is one of many.
