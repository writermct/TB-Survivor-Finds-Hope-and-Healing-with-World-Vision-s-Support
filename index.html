                <h1>TB Survivor Finds Hope and Healing with World Vision's Support</h1>
                <p>
                    Nanu* and her husband Huli* live in a bamboo hut perched on a hilltop in Mae Fa Luang, a Chiang Rai village 12 kilometers from the Thai-Myanmar border. Born in the Myanmar jungle as part of the Lahu ethnic minority group, Nanu has now been living in Thailand for 30 years. She’s a mother of three, aged five to 17. “We had five children, but one passed away and the other was adopted by Huli's sister,” she shares.

Like many migrants, Nanu's work varies depending on what is available—whether it’s carrying sand at construction sites, working on farms, or doing housework. Time and again Nanu has met adversity with courage and resilience, and this was especially true when she was diagnosed with tuberculosis at just 25 years old.

            When Nanu began experiencing persistent pain on one side of her body, along with arm spasms and a chronic cough, she was unsure where to seek help. Community members recommended Mae Fa Luang hospital, where migrants could access free screening and testing. There doctors discovered Nanu had contracted tuberculosis. Reflecting on her diagnosis, Nanu says “I didn’t feel much during this time. I just knew I needed to take the medicine so I could get better and get back to work on the farm.” She started the seven-month treatment and began to feel better, so she and her husband followed the path of many migrant workers and moved south to Betong for agricultural work. But she started to feel sick again. At the hospital in Betong, she was told she couldn’t be treated due to her financial and legal status. Huli says he broke down crying but found hope in the services at Mae Fa Luang, “I was overwhelmed with sadness, but I knew Mae Fa Luang Hospital would treat her for free. I knew we had to come back.”

            Nanu returned to Mae Fa Luang and began a second round of TB treatment. “I was too sick to work and I was afraid my kids wouldn’t have enough to eat, but I was very confident the doctor would be able to treat me and I could get back to normal,” she says. During this time, the family relied heavily on assistance from World Vision. World Vision staff members administered the at-home TB treatments every two weeks and provided living support to the family through Global Fund. “I felt very glad that the World Vision staff came to visit me during this time, and I was very thankful for their help because it meant we had enough to feed the family,” she says. “World Vision staff came to our home several times with eggs, tinned fish, rice, salt, and noodles.”

                    When World Vision staff visited Nanu for a check up towards the end of her treatment, she was already back at work carrying sand. Huli beams with pride, “When she started healing, I felt very proud. I also felt very happy that I have a companion again and we can go out to work together.” When asked about her dreams for their family’s future, it is clear there is only room for pragmatism. “I have to continue fighting, fighting to survive, to make money and continue living. If I can’t work hard, my family won’t have anything to eat.”

   Fighting to survive is the harsh reality for many of the migrants from Myanmar’s ethnic minority groups. In these conditions, contracting tuberculosis doesn't just have grave consequences for the person who is sick; it often means hunger for the whole family. World Vision’s work through Global Fund, supporting screening, testing, and treatment for tuberculosis, alongside the provision of living assistance, is a lifeline to the migrant communities in Mae Fa Luang. Nanu's story is just one example among many others who have received support.
